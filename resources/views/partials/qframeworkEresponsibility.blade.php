These values can then be applied to relevant economic, environmental, social and governance (EESG) issues such as conflicts of interest; gifts and hospitality; political donations and lobbying; bribery and corruption; data privacy; use of social media; diversity; human rights; and treatment of or interactions with workers, communities and the environment.')}}

In some situations, in order to build trust in the mechanism, it may be helpful to have an independent third-party manage the mechanism and report back to the company on the results. The creation of a culture of trust and openness also entails ensuring that workers (employees and contract workers) and suppliers have the confidence, and are encouraged, to raise issues of concern, and that protection is provided to those who speak out. This, in turn, is more likely to result in the early identification and prevention of unacceptable behaviours, enabling companies to protect their reputation, reduce financial losses, improve employee morale and reduce turnover.')}}

In the convention document, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan stated that, “Corruption hurts the poor disproportionately by diverting funds intended for development, undermining a Government’s ability to provide basic services, feeding inequality and injustice and discouraging foreign aid and investment.
